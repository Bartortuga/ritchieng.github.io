## Pandas Series by Data School
 
This is a free course offered by Data School. 

- [Introduction to Pandas](http://www.dataschool.io/easier-data-analysis-with-pandas/)


## Review
If you do not like reading books or guides, this is a very good series. You might think it's simply a series of videos but it covers a lot of essential parts of pandas that allow you to have an adequate knowledge to work with scikit-learn and actual data sets. 

Again, I cannot emphasize how Mark has a way to deliver simple and succinct explanations on complicated topics. This is very important for beginners. 

I hope you found the notes that I have derived from the course useful! They are some variations on Github by others so feel free to use them too if you feel their explanations are clearer. 

I will be moving on to Udacity's Machine Learning nanodegree along with other online resources where I will document my progress. You can view my personal list on how to be a Machine Learning Engineer [here](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-resources/).

All the best, Ritchie.
