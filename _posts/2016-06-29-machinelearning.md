## Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
 
So I just started this course and I have documented my notes under [Machine Learning](http://127.0.0.1:4005/machine-learning/). I made it to the end of week 3 in 7 days while committing a few hours everyday. Rather slow but I am currently travelling now with commitments so I have to make do.

I intend to complete this course in another 6 more days. Sure I can.
