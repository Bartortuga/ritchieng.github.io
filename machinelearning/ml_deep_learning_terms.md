| Term        | Description           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Jacobian matrix      | The matrix containing all partial derivatives of a function whose input and output are both vectors. |
| Hessian matrix     | Similar to Jacobian matrix but it contains the second derivatives collected in a matrix.     |
| First-order optimization algorithms | Optimization algorithms that use only a gradient such as gradient descent. |
| Second-order optimization algorithms | Optimization algorithms that use Hessian matrix like Newton's method |
| Constrained Optimization | Find the maximal or miimal value of $f(x)$ |
| Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Approach | General solution to constrained optimization making use of generalized Lagrange function (Lagrangian) |
| KKT Conditions | Simple set of properties that describe the optimal points of constrained optimization problems. |
| Hyperparameters | Machine algorithms' settings that must be determined external to the learning algorithm itself |
| Accuracy | Proportion of examples for which the model produces the correct output |
| Error rate | Proportion of examples for which the model produces an incorrect output |
| Design matrix | Matrix containing a different example in each row |
