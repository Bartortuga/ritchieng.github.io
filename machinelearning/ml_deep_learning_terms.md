| Term        | Description           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Jacobian matrix      | The matrix containing all partial derivatives of a function whose input and output are both vectors. |
| Hessian matrix     | Similar to Jacobian matrix but it contains the second derivatives collected in a matrix.     |
| First-order optimization algorithms | Optimization algorithms that use only a gradient such as gradient descent. |
| Second-order optimization algorithms | Optimization algorithms that use Hessian matrix like Newton's method |
