## Machine Learning: Statistical Learning

In this section, you can learn about the theory of Machine Learning and applying the theories using Octave or Python. Octave (open-source version of Matlab) is useful for rapid prototyping before mapping the code to Python.


This introduction is derived from Machine Learning, a course taught by Andrew Ng from Stanford University. There are other introductions such as Data School and Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.
