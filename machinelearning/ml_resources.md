## Machine Learning Resources

These are the resources you can use to become a machine learning engineer. All resources are free unless you require certifications. I recommend them in the chronological order I have specified. This is not an exhaustive list as I strive to add more. Simply write your recommendations in the comments' section and I will add them in!
