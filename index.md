## Hello! 

I am Ritchie Ng, a machine learning engineer from the National University of Singapore (NUS) specializing in deep learning and computer vision. 

Currently, I am conducting research in the areas of deep learning and hyperparameter optimization in NUS. And I live in University Town, NUS, as a Global Merit Scholar. Feel free to drop me a message if you are ever around NUS, I've a lot of free meal credits to spare! 

I started this website to document my personal guides on machine learning. This website allows anyone to easily search for a guide I wrote. You can use the Google Search function to easily search for guides too. 

Oh yes! You can check out some of my "cool" stickman [comics](http://www.ritchieng.com/tag_comic_series/) on Machine Learning if you are looking to chillax with my stickman.

## My Publications
I'm currently working on 2 other papers relating to reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks and hyperparameter optimization. 

**Deep Reinforcement Learning for Accelerating the Convergence Rate, Submitted ICLR 2017**
