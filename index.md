## Purpose of Website

To provide free guides and notes on Machine Learning, Data Science and Algorithmic Trading.

## About My Educational Background

I am a self-taught programmer specialising in applying data science and machine learning to algorithmic trading. I used to trade stocks in Singapore manually. I had enough of attempting to keep my emotions in check, making manual trades and digesting a huge amount of data manually using Excel. As such, I am currently building an automated end-to-end algorithmic trading ecosystem trading my own assets.

You would come to realise that I do not have a computer science degree. But it does not stop anyone, including myself, from being competent in programming, statistics or mathematics in general.

Instead, I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Finance, and Economic and Policy Analysis under a concurrent degree programme: Bachelor in Business Administration (BBA) and Master in Public Policy (MPP) in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Also, I am an NUS Global Merit Scholar where my school fees, college accommodation, overseas programmes and allowance are covered under the auspices of NUS. As a result, I got the oppportunity to study in Bocconi University, Milan, Italy for 6 months and the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA for another 6 months in 2016! Check out my posts on my journey through studying in 3 continents.

## About My Professional Background
At age 12, I started a gaming business generating thousands in net profit per month. I closed it to pursue my studies.

At age 18, I started a company, Tesglo, specialising in materials science and grew it to become a GST-registered firm having an array of MNCs as our loyal clientele. It has been profitable every year and it funds my tech ventures.

At age 21, I joined Indo-Sing Business Advisory (ISBA) and built their technological infrastructure. I also worked with the Managing Director to lead debt restructuring and equity raising deals in India, Indonesia and Singapore for a year. I realised many areas in the investment banking sector can be automated and I have since dedicated my life to software engineering.

At age 22, I subsequently dived into tech start-ups and started Kinsheep. My team shortly  clinched the prestigious grant VaSCo grant.

Currently I am building an end-to-end algorithmic trading ecosystem using machine learning and data scrapping algorithms.

## Location
I am currently based in the sunny island, Singapore.
