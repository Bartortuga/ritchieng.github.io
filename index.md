## Hello! 

I started this website to document my guides on machine learning. This website allows me to easily search for a guide I wrote. You can use the Google Search function to easily search for guides too. 

Oh yes! I am a budding machine learning engineer specializing in deep learning, reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence with images and videos.

## About My Educational Background

You would come to realize that I do not have a computer science degree. But it does not stop anyone, including myself, from being competent in programming, statistics and mathematics in general.

Instead, I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Finance, and Economic and Policy Analysis under a concurrent degree programme: Bachelor in Business Administration (BBA) and Master in Public Policy (MPP), National University of Singapore (NUS). I took mostly quantitative courses in the later years in NUS relating to econometrics and data analytics.

Also, I am an NUS Global Merit Scholar where my school fees, food, college accommodation, overseas programmes and allowance are covered under the auspices of NUS. As a result, I got the opportunity to study in Bocconi University, Milan, Italy for 6 months and the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA for another 6 months in 2016. It was an amazing journey where I travelled to more than 15 countries. 

## About My Professional Background
Before 2014, I started a company, [Tesglo](http://www.tesglo.com), specializing in materials science and grew it to become a GST-registered firm having an array of MNCs as our loyal clientele. It has been profitable every year and it funds my tech ventures.

In 2014, I joined Indo-Sing Business Advisory [(ISBA)](http://www.isbabiz.com/about/) and built their technological infrastructure. Subsequently, I went on to lead web development at [Moirai](http://www.moiraidesign.com), a high-end fashion firm where every single apparel is unique.

In 2015, I co-founded [Kinsheep](http://www.jfdi.asia/blog/jfdi-discover-helps-kinsheep-win-10k), a social networking application, using a full-stack Javascript framework including Ionic, NodeJS and MongoDB. My team shortly clinched the prestigious VaSCo grant from NUS School of Computing.

In 2016, I went on to become a full-stack Javascript web developer specializing in ReactJS, Meteor and MongoDB and built [reviw.me](https://www.reviw.me), a web application that allows people to review their financial consultants, and [PeerCapita](https://www.peercapita.com), specializing in connecting investors with collaterized loans.

Currently, I specialize in deep learning with images and videos.

## Location
I am currently based in a sunny island called Singapore.
