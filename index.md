## Hello! 

I am Ritchie Ng, a machine learning engineer from the National University of Singapore (NUS) specializing in deep learning and computer vision. 

Currently, I am conducting research in the areas of deep learning and hyperparameter optimization in NUS. And I live in University Town, NUS, as a Global Merit Scholar. Feel free to drop me a message if you are ever around NUS, I've a lot of free meal credits to spare! 

I started this website to document my personal guides on machine learning. This website allows anyone to easily search for a guide I wrote. You can use the Google Search function to easily search for guides too. 

Oh yes! You can check out some of my "cool" [comics](http://www.ritchieng.com/tag_comic_series/) on Machine Learning if you are looking for something less technical.

## My Projects

**Large Scale Identification of Multiple Digits from Real-world Images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
<br />This project uses TensorFlow and TensorBoard extensively. 
<br />[Open-source Code](https://github.com/ritchieng/NumNum)
<br />[Report](https://github.com/ritchieng/NumNum/blob/master/NumNum/report/report.pdf)

**Training a smart cab using Recurrent Learning**
<br />This project uses Python and PyGame to train a smart cab with Recurrent Learning.

## Headshot
This is me attempting to look dapper with my blazer, albeit I rarely wear suits.
